###  Follow-up work
For follow-up experiments with an improved biologically plausible simulation of cortical prosthetic vision (described in [this pre-print](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.23.521749)), see [this branch](https://github.com/neuralcodinglab/viseon/tree/dynaphos-paper) in the current repository, and [this repository](https://github.com/neuralcodinglab/dynaphos) for the source code of the new simulator.

We also refer to [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1142/S0129065722500526) by Küçükoğlu et al. on the optimization of neuroprosthetic vision via end-to-end deep reinforcement learning.
